# Catan Conqueror: Intelligent Bot for Settlers of Catan

---

### Project Overview  
An intelligent bot designed to master the classic board game *Settlers of Catan*. This project aims to implement a bot that can compete against human players by leveraging both strategy and probabilistic decision-making, incorporating the elements of chance (e.g., dice rolls) and strategic planning (e.g., resource management, negotiation, and route optimization) inherent in the game.

### üß≠ Goal

Our objective is to develop a bot capable of competing at a level comparable to human players in *Catan*. We benchmark performance against:
- A **random-move bot** baseline.
- **Human-level competition** where each team member will play the bot multiple times. The target win rate is set to >1/n (where *n* is the number of players), indicating human-competitive performance.

**Why It‚Äôs Interesting**  
The game dynamics of *Catan* involve complex decision-making under uncertainty, making this a fascinating problem for AI development. This project blends AI, game theory, and decision modeling in a multi-agent environment.

### üß† Decision-Making Process

The bot‚Äôs decisions are modeled as a **Sequential Decision Problem**, with actions affecting game states, opponents, and the bot's path to victory.  
- **States**: The bot‚Äôs resources, board position, visible opponent positions, and a probabilistic model of resource generation.
- **Actions**: Building (settlements, cities, roads), trading (with players or bank), strategic moves like using Development Cards or placing the robber.
- **Transitions**: Determined by dice rolls, trade outcomes, and resource constraints.
- **Rewards**: Points toward winning the game, with intermediate rewards from strategic positioning, resource control, or robber placement.

### üé≤ Key Sources of Uncertainty

- **Dice Rolls**: Randomly determine resource generation.
- **Opponent Behavior**: Unpredictable actions like trade offers and robber placements require adaptability.
- **Limited Information**: Only partial visibility into opponents‚Äô resources adds complexity.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Sketch

Our initial approach simplifies the problem to a 1v1 game, modeling it as a **multi-agent POMDP** where each agent seeks to maximize points. The bot‚Äôs decision-making combines POMDP-based strategy with heuristic approaches for resource and trade management.
